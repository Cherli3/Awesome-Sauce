           <p class="Center"> Hello! My name is Charlie and I am an Australian developer and I'm currently in the process of developing a retro first person shooter called Cult of Perdition in the Godot engine.</p>
           <p class="Center"> My goal is to one day start my own indie game studio called Hollow Brain or atleast just make game development my full time job.</p>
           <p class="Center"> I started using Blender in 2019 and eventually picked up Unreal Engine in 2020.</p>
           <p class="Center"> After a while, on the 20th of August 2023, I made a tough choice to ditch what I knew and move to the Godot Game Engine.</p>
           <p class="Center"> I know a decent ammount of GDScript and im a beginner in HTML (at the time of writing) but i can always learn more.</p>
           <p class="Center"> I have been interested in coding and game development ever since I was little. I would make games in Roblox and even in Minecraft using Command Blocks.</p>
           <p class="Center"> I have always been interested in art, I started pixel art back in 2014 and I have a small hobby of photography.</p>
